# Image Localization

Experimenting Image Localization using Genetic Algorithm\n
To run, specify the image filename in either `one_scale.py` or `two_scale.py` and then run either of the file
It will take quiet a long time to run since the algorithm efficiency is exponential with image dimension (usually 2 to 3 minutes)
